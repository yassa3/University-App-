<h2> 1)	Brief Overview of the Project:</h2> 
The University Data Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline and optimize the management of student, doctors, course, department, and grade-related data within the university environment. It encompasses various components such as database design, SQL and PLSQL implementation, automation scripting, Java application development, and integration to ensure efficient data handling and reporting capabilities.
<h2> 2)	Objectives and Goals:</h2>
•	Designing and implementing a robust relational database schema to store and manage student, doctors, course, department, grades, GPA history information securely.<br>
•	Developing SQL and PLSQL scripts to facilitate data manipulation tasks and perform complex calculations such as GPA computation.<br>
•	Implementing automation scripts to automate routine tasks like database backup, disk space monitoring, and anomaly detection for system reliability.<br>
•	Creating a Java application following OOP principles to interact with the database, enabling CRUD operations and seamless integration.<br>
•	Generating comprehensive reports within the Java application to provide valuable insights into courses, enrolled students, and average GPA per course.<br>
<h2> 3)	Summary of Technologies and Methodologies Used:</h2>
•	Utilization of SQL for database schema creation and normalization to maintain data integrity.<br>
•	Implementation of SQL and PLSQL for data querying, manipulation, and procedural tasks.<br>
•	Development of Bash scripts for automating critical system maintenance tasks.<br>
•	Use of Java SE and OOP principles for building a robust application with efficient data handling capabilities.<br>
•	Seamless integration between the Java application and the SQL database to ensure smooth data flow and reporting.<br>
•	Adherence to software engineering best practices, including documentation, testing, and version control, for project quality and maintainability.
